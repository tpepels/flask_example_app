# flask_example_app
Example database application for my favorite students.

This demo shows the following:
- Creating a simple Flask app
- Using SQLAlchemy with Flask to create a model
- "Safely" storing passwords to a database (note that there are many more considerations when working securely with passwords, this merely shows how to securely store them in a database)
- The possibility to use many different views
- Templating with Jinja
- Using different REST endpoints for different client purposes
